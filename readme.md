# ComfyUI wrapper nodes for [HunyuanVideo](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo)

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Experimental DownloadAndLoadHyVideoTextEncoder Node:
- Get models from LLM folder.
- Norm "Slider".
- Support for any llama model type LLM.
- Support for LLava and mLLava model_type.

To install new LLMs for the text encoder, go to ComfyUI\models\LLM - open cmd and paste the git link from the model's huggingface page. Ex: git clone https://huggingface.co/Kijai/llava-llama-3-8b-text-encoder-tokenizer

# Update

Scaled dot product attention (sdpa) should now be working (only tested on Windows, torch 2.5.1+cu124 on 4090), sageattention is still recommended for speed, but should not be necessary anymore making installation much easier.

Transformer and VAE (single files, no autodownload):

https://huggingface.co/Kijai/HunyuanVideo_comfy/tree/main

Go to the usual ComfyUI folders (diffusion_models and vae)

LLM text encoder (has autodownload):

https://huggingface.co/Kijai/llava-llama-3-8b-text-encoder-tokenizer

Files go to `ComfyUI/models/LLM/llava-llama-3-8b-text-encoder-tokenizer`

Clip text encoder (has autodownload)

Either use any Clip_L model supported by ComfyUI by disabling the clip_model in the text encoder loader and plugging in ClipLoader to the text encoder node, or 
allow the autodownloader to fetch the original clip model from:

https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14, (only need the .safetensor from the weights, and all the config files) to:

`ComfyUI/models/clip/clip-vit-large-patch14`

Memory use is entirely dependant on resolution and frame count, don't expect to be able to go very high even on 24GB. 

Good news is that the model can do functional videos even at really low resolutions.
